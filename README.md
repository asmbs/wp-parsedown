# WP Parsedown

A [Parsedown][parsedown] wrapper for WordPress. When activated, this plugin completely disables the visual editor. It also introduces a real-time preview box in the editor, so you can preview your parsed Markdown as you're writing it.

**Additional features:**

*   Inserting an image via the Media Library generates a clean shortcode, rather than an ugly `img` or `figure` conglomeration.
*   A cheatsheet is available under the **Help** pull-down in the editor.
